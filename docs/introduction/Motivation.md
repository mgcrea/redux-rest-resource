# Motivation

Interacting with multiple REST resources is often the very basis of many web applications, interacting with theses resources via an abstraction layer **saves you from writing log of boilerplate code** and ensures that **your code stays [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)**.

**Redux REST resource** closely follow the three fundamental principles of Redux:

- Single source of truth
- State is read-only
- Changes are made with pure functions
