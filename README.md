Dead simple and ready-to-use store module for handling HTTP REST resources.

Generates types, actions and reducers for you to easily interact with any REST API.

Saves you from writing a lot of boilerplate code and ensures that your code stays [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

- Requires [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) to handle async actions.

- Relies on [fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) to perform HTTP requests.

> NOTE: If you want to use this in environments without a builtin `fetch` implementation, you need to [bring your own custom fetch polyfill](advanced/CustomFetch).

## [Quickstart](http://mgcrea.github.io/redux-rest-resource/docs/usage/Quickstart.html)

Basically using a REST endpoint with Redux can be done with only a few lines:

```js
import {createResource} from 'redux-rest-resource';

const hostUrl = 'https://api.mlab.com:443/api/1/databases/sandbox/collections';
const apiKey = 'xvDjirE9MCIi800xMxi4EKeTm8e9FUBR';

export const {types, actions, rootReducer} = createResource({
  name: 'user',
  url: `${hostUrl}/users/:id?apiKey=${apiKey}`
});
```
